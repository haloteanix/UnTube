# UnTube (ALPHA)

UnTube is an Android app for devices that don't support the regular YouTube app anymore. 

This app is still in Alpha stages and will continue its development until I just get... lazy..? I guess. I don't know. This is normally just https://youtube.com but in an app.

Google Play Protect might think for (absolutely) no reason that it doesnt recognize the developer. Just click on "Install Anyway" and open UnTube.
